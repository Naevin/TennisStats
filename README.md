# Tennis Statistics

This is an app that allows for people to track the number of aces, winner, unforced errors, etc that a player and his opponent hit in a certain tennis match. The app then uses the data points to display various statistics and insights that will inform the player what they did poorly and what they did well. Some examples of data points are first serve percentage, return points won, net point conversion etc.

About me: I am a tennis player for the Johns Hopkins tennis team. I it would be cool to make something that could help my teammates improve. This app was my first exposure to Android development so I was able to pick up many technical and non technical skills. For example, I learned how to use Fragments and how to allow for Fragment to Fragment and Fragment to Activity communication, but I also learned about what makes a good intuitive User Interface. I also became aware to many things I could improve on. For example I did not really keep a consistent coding style throughout the project, and I also could have organized and modularized the code better.
